# Randoseru Bootloader

## About

Randoseru is a simplistic BIOS bootloader for x86 used for my personal OSDev projects.

The goal of Randoseru is not to be compatible with EVERYTHING but only stuff that I
happen to need.

You may use it for your projects if you adapt either the code or your project.
